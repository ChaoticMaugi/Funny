We make a quadratic field like this:
xxxxExxxxxExxxx
x1111111111111x
x1xx1xx1xx1xx1x
x1xx1xx1xx1xx1x
E1111111111111E
x1xx1xx1xx1xx1x
x1xx1xx1xx1xx1x
E1111111111111E
x1xx1xx1xx1xx1x
x1xx1xx1xx1xx1x
x1111111111111x
xxxxExxxxxExxxx

where 	x = Wall
	1 = way
	E = Exit
Now the fun part is that the sailor starts at a given or random location and just starts to randomly walk in one of the four directions.
The sailor is home when he reaches a given oder random exit.
Let's see how he has to walk with a monte carlo simulation!!
